  - `git clone https://github.com/junegunn/vim-github-dashboard.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-github-dashboard`
- [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
  1. Add `Bundle 'junegunn/vim-github-dashboard'` to .vimrc
  2. Run `:BundleInstall`
- [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)

- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  1. Add `Plug 'junegunn/vim-github-dashboard'` to .vimrc

Requirements
------------

1. Your Vim must have Ruby support enabled. Check if `:echo has('ruby')` prints 1.
2. If you see LoadError on `:ruby require 'json/pure'`, you need to install `json_pure` gem.

### Mac OS X

The current version of Mac OS X is shipped with a Ruby-enabled Vim.
However, by default it comes with an old Ruby (1.8.7),
so you still need to install `json_pure` (or `json`) gem.

```sh
sudo gem install json_pure
```

If your Vim crashes, try installing a newer version of Vim
with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/).

### Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems vim-nox && sudo /usr/bin/gem install json_pure
```

(Reference: [Installing vim with ruby support (+ruby)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3794895/installing-vim-with-ruby-support-ruby))

### Windows

1. Download and install the [official GVim](http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc)
2. Download a newer build of GVim executable from [here](http://wyw.dcweb.cn/#download) and replace the existing one
3. Download and install Ruby 1.9.3 using [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). You must check `Add Ruby executable to your PATH` option.

Commands
--------

### With authentication

- `:GHDashboard`
- `:GHDashboard USER`
- `:GHActivity`
- `:GHActivity USER`
- `:GHActivity USER/REPO`

### Without authentication (60 calls/hour limit, only public activities)

- `:GHDashboard! USER`
- `:GHActivity! USER`
- `:GHActivity! USER/REPO`

Navigation
----------

Use `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` to navigate back and forth through the links.

Press `Enter` key or `double-click` on a link to open it in the browser.

Press `R` to refresh the window.

Press `q` to close the window.

Authentication
--------------

When you first run `:GHDashboard` or `:GHActivity` command,
you will be asked to enter your GitHub username and the password.
Once it is successfully authenticated, the Vim process will remember
the credentials and will no more ask for them.

If you don't want to be asked for username and password, you can set up
`g:github_dashboard` variable as follows.

```vim
let g:github_dashboard = { 'username': 'you', 'password': 'secret' }
```

Since having plain-text password in your .vimrc is not the most secure
thing you can do, it is strongly recommended that you don't put password in
your Vim configuration file.

```vim
let g:github_dashboard = { 'username': 'you' }
```

### Without authentication

In fact, GitHub API allows you to browse dashboard or activity stream
without authentication, though the hourly rate is limited to 60.
Well, that's good enough as long as you don't check GitHub page every
minute. Use bang commands then: `:GHDashboard!` and `:GHActivity!`.

### Caveat about Github Two-factor authentication

If you enabled [Github Two-factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/two_factor_authentication/configure), then you can not login with your `username` and `password`, but you can generate a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/applications).


Optional configuration
----------------------

```vim
let g:github_dashboard = {}

" Dashboard window position
" - Options: tab, top, bottom, above, below, left, right
" - Default: tab
let g:github_dashboard['position'] = 'top'

" Disable Emoji output
" - Default: only enable on terminal Vim on Mac
let g:github_dashboard['emoji'] = 0

" Customize emoji (see http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)
let g:github_dashboard['emoji_map'] = {
\   'user_dashboard': 'blush',
\   'user_activity':  'smile',
\   'repo_activity':  'laughing',
\   'ForkEvent':      'fork_and_knife'
\ }

" Command to open link URLs
" - Default: auto-detect
let g:github_dashboard['open_command'] = 'open'

" API timeout in seconds
" - Default: 10, 20
let g:github_dashboard['api_open_timeout'] = 10
let g:github_dashboard['api_read_timeout'] = 20

" Do not set statusline
" - Then you can customize your own statusline with github_dashboard#status()
let g:github_dashboard['statusline'] = 0
```

_"Why Ruby?"_
-------------

1. This is a personal fun project, and I like Ruby, so why not?
2. Ruby allows me to access GitHub API without another Vim plugin or an external executable
3. Mac OS X (which I use the most) is shipped with a Ruby-enabled Vim, so it's pretty easy to set up
